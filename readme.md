A simple tool to log your thoughts and consolidate them as a blog post.

`python blog.py start 'Blog Title / Topic'` - opens up a vim instance. Write your content and `:wq` once done. Keep repeating this for every log on that topic.

`python blog.py generate` - Generates .txt/.md files for each post.

`python blog.py server` - Serves your output posts directory on port 3000. 

Modify options `config.py` as per your choice.
